            <h3>The <em>Sagittarius</em> constellation♐️</h3>
            <p>At the end and of every year, approximately between <em>November 23 and December 21</em>, the sun passes through the Sagittarius constellation. The Greeks called Sagittarius The Archer, because it reminded them of the centaur, who was represented by the symbol of a bow and arrow, in their mythology.

            <h3>The <em>Capricorn</em> constellation♑️</h3> 

            <p>The sun transits through the Capricorn constellation in <em>January through February</em>. It’s sometimes called The Sea Goat, since the ancient Greeks compared it to a goat with a fish instead of a tail. It is one of the four cardinal signs and it traditionally marked the winter solstice. The name Capricorn is a direct heritage from the ancient Greeks. As the myth goes, Capricorn was the first hybrid creature created by Hermes, the messenger god.</p>

            <p>Capricornus is actually the <strong>smallest</strong> of the 12 zodiac constellations, covers 413.95 square degrees of the southern sky.</p>

            <h3>The <em>Aquarius</em> constellation♒️</h3> 

            <p><em>In February</em>, it’s Aquarius, or the Water Bear, which is on the path of the sun along the ecliptic. This constellation is one of the oldest we know, as it was coined by the ancient Babylonians, who thought it resembled an old man pouring water from a pitcher. This metaphor meant to them that Aquarius was the bringer of rain. It was also a symbol of knowledge and wisdom. </p>
                        
            <p>Covering an area of 979.85 square degrees, Aquarius is the <strong>second largest</strong> zodiac constellation and the tenth largest constellation in our sky.</p>

            <h3>The <em>Pisces</em> constellation♓️</h3> 

            <p>Pisces, or “The Fishes”, becomes prominent in the ecliptic every year in the <em>month of March</em>.

            <p>Aries shows up in the <em>month of April</em>. This constellation of the Zodiac is also known as “The Ram”, and is one of the four cardinal signs.
